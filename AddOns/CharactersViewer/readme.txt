Version 2.0 Beta Release Notes! 
General Note:
	Important Note: 
		1.	The addons require rpgoCharacterProfiler, included in the download.  The version included is the official rpgoCharacterProfile 1.6.1.
			Note that Calvin (rpgoCP author), is in contact almost daily with me for our project.
	
		2.	This version of CV isn't integrated in Cosmos, and will only be once it's out of Beta state.  
		
		3.	Please download this version only if you want to help CV improvement.  Expect some behavior to be different than before.
				
	Sidenote to other addons coder interacting with CV.  I tryed to minimize the "damage" caused by the major code ravamp.  Please contact me soo I can provide the required API function.
	I tryted to maintain the most legacy function, but if you where tapping to CV data, I can manage to create a function returning the correct data for you, or simply tap directly in rpgoCharacterProfiler.
	EquipCompare will be fixed for 1.12 release, as stated by Legorol. 

	If you want someting 100% stable, don't download the newer version, and wait for other people to suggest improvement / report bug.
