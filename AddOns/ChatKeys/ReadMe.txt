ChatKeys v 3.0 : 10/29/2007.
-------------------------------------------------------

By Zax - Freeware.

This AddOn is based on:
	- EasyChatChange AddOn by Toewalker
	- Alternative Global Strings AddOn by Viper

Partial german localization by DaMadness.

-------------------------------------------------------
Tired of opening the chat window and typing "/p " to start a party message, or "/3 " to start a message on the defense channel? 
The main goal of this WoW AddOn is to allow you to bind keys - from the standard shortcuts panel - to start chat messages for all the following standard channels:
	- say
	- yell
	- party
	- raid (if applicable, else party)
	- raid warning
	- BattleGround (if applicable, else Local defense)
	- guild
	- guild officers
	- General
	- Trade
	- Group search

ChatKeys offers others bindable keys:
	- a key to start a message on 3 custom channels, defined with an settings panel (UI).
	- a key to start an emote (/em).
	- a key to whisper to a defined friend. This (girl/boy)friend's name can be defined with the UI.
	- a key to whisper to your target, assuming your target is a friendly player.

Other features:
	- Optionnaly displays party numbers on raid channel.
	- ChatKeys removes annoying [Guild], [Party], [Raid], [Whisper to], [Whisper from] prefix from chat. [Officer] prefix is replaced by [OFF]. [Read Leader] prefix is replaced by [LEAD]. [Raid alert] prefix is replaced by [ATT].
	- Optionnaly plays a sound. Please note that this feature is disabled because at this release time WoW already plays sound when a whisper is received.

Quick Start
-------------------------------------------------------
Just open the standard shortcut panel (keybindings) and bind keys for ChatKeys.

Development note
-------------------------------------------------------
This AddOn searches asked channels by name and not by number because channels numbers can varies.
That's why it is localization-dependant and will not work with unlocalized language.
Thanks to DaMadness for is german localization.
