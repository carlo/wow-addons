This addon adds information to the tooltip to remind you that you could buy an item from a vendor instead.  Never get swindled again!

------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION: Put the SwindlerPreventer folder into your World Of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns folder and launch WoW.

FEATURES: Whenever you see a tradeable item (on the Auction House, in loot, or wherever) that's also available from a vendor, the tooltip will provide a list of who sells it and where you can find them.

CHAT COMMANDS:
	/swindlerpreventer (or /swp) <command>
where <command> can be any of the following:
	help - Print this list.
	[item link] - Show info for an item in the chat window.

CAVEATS, KNOWN BUGS, ETC.: 
	- Many vendors that sell "interesting" items have a limited supply of such (which replenishes on a timer of a few hours or more). If a vendor listed by Swindler Preventer doesn't have the item you're looking for, it may just have already been bought by another player. You'll have to stick around or check back again to be sure.
	- Swindler Preventer lists vendors of your faction (Alliance/Horde) and neutral vendors only. Some recipes are only sold to one side, though they can be resold through the neutral Auction House.

VERSION HISTORY

3.0.3b - 2008/11/17
- Bought a port to Dalaran and added Dalaran Recipe vendors, which were probably the spammiest.  Keep the data submission coming!

3.0.3a - 2008/11/10
- Added more data.

3.0.3 - 2008/11/09
- Fixed slash command.  Thanks Joel!
- Added Containers of all kinds.  Only the exact version that can be bought from a vendor is included, though.  For instance, a Small Black Pouch will not list that it can be bought from a vendor, even though it's the exact same size as a Small Brown one.  So just be wary, if you don't care about the color of your bag, and only the size, look for the 'brown' color for vendor information.
- Added 'detection' for Vanity Pets, Quivers/Ammo Pouches, and Containers for English localization.  This data seems to be incomplete on websites such as WoWDigger, Thottbot, WoWHead, etc., so please report any data you find!  You can report any information found to the website you downloaded from or directly to me at Thortok2000@msn.com.  Please include the entire in-game message.

3.0.2a - 2008/11/03
- Added some reported recipes.

3.0 - 2008/10/25
- Took over the addon 'AdSpace' and at original author's request, renamed it.  New name is 'Swindler Preventer'!  Will include info on tradeable items beyond just recipes.  Will start with vanity pets.
